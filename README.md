# Oil Spill Detection Algorithm

## Overview

This project was developed as part of an internship at Shell India Markets Private Limited (May 2023 - July 2023). The primary goal was to create an innovative oil spill detection algorithm utilizing deep learning methodologies, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze RGB images for accurate detection and assessment of oil spills in marine environments.

## Features

- **Deep Learning for Oil Spill Detection**: Developed a CNN-based algorithm for detecting oil spills in RGB images.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Frameworks**: Utilized TensorFlow and PyTorch for training and validating the algorithm.
- **Collaborative Development**: Worked with multidisciplinary teams to integrate domain-specific knowledge from environmental science and remote sensing.
- **Python and Image Processing**: Implemented the algorithm in Python, employing OpenCV for preprocessing and feature extraction.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Deployed the algorithm using Streamlit for real-time monitoring capabilities.
